Given a user input of the format country, city, gender and population with brown eyes.  A program that prompts user for an input, reads it in and generates a report summarizing total population with brown eyes by country, city and gender. This program also parses the users  input and generates error messages if a wrong input is entered. This was a coding challenge and it uses different concepts of objected oriented programming.
